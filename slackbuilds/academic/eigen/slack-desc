# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

eigen: eigen (Matrix algebra on C++ templates)
eigen:
eigen: Eigen is a set of C++ headers for linear algebra, based on C++98
eigen: templates. It supports any matrix size, all standard numeric types
eigen: including std::complex. It uses explicit vectorization for many SIMD
eigen: instructions. Eigen is tested through its own test suite, as well as
eigen: through the standard BLAS and part of LAPACK ones.
