Davix aims to make the task of managing files over HTTP-based protocols
simple. It is being developed by IT-ST at CERN, and while the project's
purpose is its use on the CERN grid, the functionality offered is
generic.

HTTP is versatile enough to be fit for this purpose; PUT, MOVE and
DELETE requests can be used for basic file manipulation (uploading,
moving, and deleting a file, respectively).

Some common file-management operations are not possible to do with
plain HTTP, however, which is why the WebDAV extensions were developed,
which davix supports. Davix also supports a plethora of authentication
methods:

    x509 user certificate
    VOMS proxy
    RFC proxy with VOMS extensions support
    username / password
    AWS S3 compatible services
    Microsoft Azure compatible services

Davix provides a shared library as well as a few command line tools.
The library offers two sets of APIs, a file-oriented and a POSIX-like
interface.
